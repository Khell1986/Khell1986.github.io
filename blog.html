			<p>Hi, I’m Kim Hellmer. I’m also a solution based problem solver.
			I’ve always liked to fix stuff. I’m pretty good at taking something
			that’s damaged and making it functional again. I have a decade of
			experience in “fixing” people and twice that in troubleshooting with technology.
			I use empathy and compassion to make real connections with people; personally
			going the extra mile to earn lifelong clients. </p>
			<p>Currently, I’m going to the YWEB Career Academy.
			With the skills I’ve learned there, and a lot more training,
			I’ll move into a career in IT Security. Challenging situations
			bring out the best in me and the constant uphill battle to keep
